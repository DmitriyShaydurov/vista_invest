          The term ‘off market’ is a much sought after term in the property industry, as ‘off market’ signifies a property that is not openly advertised to the general public.
          Through our extensive network of contacts we have exclusive access to properties which are completely off market and are offered at discounted rates to current market prices.
          These properties are in key investment areas with maximum investment opportunity based on a mixture of income generation and capital growth.
