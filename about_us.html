The experience, knowledge, reputation and developer relationships gained over many years allows Vista Invest to offer secure, high yielding, high quality, property investments and alternative investments from only credible developers with a proven track record.<h3 class="location-header">WHAT INVESTMENTS DOES VISTA INVEST OFFER?</h3>Only the top performing asset classes are recommended with proven year on year upward trajectory in key destinations. Offering fixed returns, affordable capital outlay, capital growth and clearly defined exits. To ensure your investment delivers maximum satisfaction. In addition, through our extensive network of contacts we also have exclusive access to properties which are completely off market and are offered at discounted rates to current market prices. We also have an affiliation with a partner who have a range of IFA’s registered with the FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) who will assist in pension transfers to either SIPP’s or SSAS’s. We therefore provide transparent SIPP/SSAS compliant, sustainable UK and European property investments<h3 class="location-header">CAN I VIEW MY PROPOSED INVESTMENT PRIOR TO GOING AHEAD?</h3>Yes, guided tours can be arranged, by appointment, at any time you wish. However, this isn’t always necessary unless you plan to live in the property. Many investors come from overseas and are unable to do this. We will therefore provide all necessary information, floor plans, photos and in some cases live video feeds. When choosing your investment property it is important to remember that the key components are based on financial logic only and provided it stacks up and will deliver the income you are looking for, how it looks and feels is not always of high importance.<h3 class="location-header">WHAT RETURNS CAN I EXPECT?</h3>Returns vary based on location, asset class and level of investment. Many products offer higher yields as capital outlay increases. Typically, you can expect between 7 – 15% per annum. This is usually paid on a quarterly basis. However, there are income based and growth options available. By selecting a growth option you can maximise your returns and coupled with capital uplift on exit, in some cases you can achieve as much as 20% per annum blended returns<h3 class="location-header">WHAT BUYING COSTS ARE INVOLVED?</h3>Vista Invest does not charge any administration, handling or procurement fees and many alternative investments do not have any additional costs over and above the purchase price. However, the usual associated costs, such as legal fees and stamp duty are applied when purchasing a property and all costs will be provided prior to making your investment.<h3 class="location-header">HOW SAFE IS MY MONEY?</h3>Vista Invest only works with developers who have an established track record and can provide evidence of their financial security or who have significant levels of financial backing. Stringent due diligence is carried out to make sure all legal titles, proof of ownership and planning is in place and full title deed or leasehold is given, ensuring full ownership and protection. ** Please note - at no point are investment funds received by Vista Invest. When making your investment, funds will always be transferred directly to the developer. **<h3 class="location-header">WHAT HAPPENS AFTER I INVEST?</h3>Vista Invest offer a full client liaison service after the initial investment has been made. We will liaise with the developers regarding all aspects of the investment from completion to ROI payments and exit. This will include solicitors, Finance and currency brokers, as well as management companies. Our client care has been described as first class and is the reason many investors choose to invest with us time and time again.</div><div class="mt-4"><div class="footer"><p class="mt-3">Take advantage of our exclusive news & updates.</p><button class="btn btn-outline-light mx-5" type="button">SUBSCRIBE TODAY</button><div class="social-btn"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fab" data-icon="facebook-square" class="svg-inline--fa fa-facebook-square fa-w-14 mr-3" role="img" viewBox="0 0 448 512" style="&#10;    color: white;&#10;    height: 2.8rem;&#10;"><path fill="currentColor" d="M400 32H48A48 48 0 0 0 0 80v352a48 48 0 0 0 48 48h137.25V327.69h-63V256h63v-54.64c0-62.15 37-96.48 93.67-96.48 27.14 0 55.52 4.84 55.52 4.84v61h-31.27c-30.81 0-40.42 19.12-40.42 38.73V256h68.78l-11 71.69h-57.78V480H400a48 48 0 0 0 48-48V80a48 48 0 0 0-48-48z"/></svg> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fab" data-icon="twitter-square" class="svg-inline--fa fa-twitter-square fa-w-14 mr-3" role="img" viewBox="0 0 448 512" style="&#10;    color: white;&amp;#10;&#10;    height: 2.8rem;&amp;#10;&#10;"><path fill="currentColor" d="M400 32H48C21.5 32 0 53.5 0 80v352c0 26.5 21.5 48 48 48h352c26.5 0 48-21.5 48-48V80c0-26.5-21.5-48-48-48zm-48.9 158.8c.2 2.8.2 5.7.2 8.5 0 86.7-66 186.6-186.6 186.6-37.2 0-71.7-10.8-100.7-29.4 5.3.6 10.4.8 15.8.8 30.7 0 58.9-10.4 81.4-28-28.8-.6-53-19.5-61.3-45.5 10.1 1.5 19.2 1.5 29.6-1.2-30-6.1-52.5-32.5-52.5-64.4v-.8c8.7 4.9 18.9 7.9 29.6 8.3a65.447 65.447 0 0 1-29.2-54.6c0-12.2 3.2-23.4 8.9-33.1 32.3 39.8 80.8 65.8 135.2 68.6-9.3-44.5 24-80.6 64-80.6 18.9 0 35.9 7.9 47.9 20.7 14.8-2.8 29-8.3 41.6-15.8-4.9 15.2-15.2 28-28.8 36.1 13.2-1.4 26-5.1 37.8-10.2-8.9 13.1-20.1 24.7-32.9 34z"/></svg> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fab" data-icon="linkedin" class="svg-inline--fa fa-linkedin fa-w-14" role="img" viewBox="0 0 448 512" style="&#10;    color: white;&amp;#10;&#10;    height: 2.8rem;&amp;#10;&#10;"><path fill="currentColor" d="M416 32H31.9C14.3 32 0 46.5 0 64.3v383.4C0 465.5 14.3 480 31.9 480H416c17.6 0 32-14.5 32-32.3V64.3c0-17.8-14.4-32.3-32-32.3zM135.4 416H69V202.2h66.5V416zm-33.2-243c-21.3 0-38.5-17.3-38.5-38.5S80.9 96 102.2 96c21.2 0 38.5 17.3 38.5 38.5 0 21.3-17.2 38.5-38.5 38.5zm282.1 243h-66.4V312c0-24.8-.5-56.7-34.5-56.7-34.6 0-39.9 27-39.9 54.9V416h-66.4V202.2h63.7v29.2h.9c8.9-16.8 30.6-34.5 62.9-34.5 67.2 0 79.7 44.3 79.7 101.9V416z"/></svg></div></div></div><div class="footer-black d-flex flex-row justify-content-center"><p class="text-center mt-2">© VISTA INVEST 2020 | ALL RIGHTS RESERVED | PRIVACY POLICY | T&amp;C | DISCLAIMER</p></div><div class="footer-black-mobile"><p>© VISTA INVEST 2020 | ALL RIGHTS RESERVED</p><p>PRIVACY POLICY | T&amp;C | DISCLAIMER</p></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css"><script src="js/app.min.js"></script></body></html>
